# React & Redux Testing FUNdamentals Workshop

A step-by-step workshop to add tests for a React application using Redux, all while learning testing fundamentals. Best if accompanied with live facilitation. ðŸ™‚

## Exercises

All of the exercises assume existing knowledge of React, so you may want to follow the [React FUNdamentals workshop](../react/) prior to starting here. Futhermore, the exercises make heavy use of [ES.next](http://www.benmvp.com/learning-es6-series/), so you may need to brush up on the new JavaScript features if they are unfamiliar. Each step in the workshop builds on top of the previous one. If at any point you get stuck, you can find the answers in the source code of the current step. Any step can be used as a starting point to continue on to the remaining steps.

You can start at the [beginning](00-begin/) to get set up. Afterwards follow these steps:

1. [Render (markup)](01-render-markup/)
1. [Render (components)](02-render-components/)
1. [Callbacks (markup)](03-callbacks-markup/)
1. [Callbacks (components)](04-callbacks-components/)
1. [UI State](05-ui-state/)
1. [Redux Actions](06-actions/)
1. [Redux Reducers](07-reducers/)
1. [Functional testing](08-functional/)
1. [End-to-end testing](09-e2e/)

## FUNdamental Concepts

- Testing rendered content ([Step 1](01-render-markup/) & [Step 2](02-render-components/))
- Testing event handlers ([Step 3](03-callbacks-markup/) & [Step 4](04-callbacks-components/))
- Testing UI state ([Step 5](05-ui-state/))
- Testing Redux actions ([Step 6](06-actions/))
- Testing Redux reducers ([Step 7](07-reducers/))
- Functional testing ([Step 8](08-functional/))
- End-to-end testing ([Step 9](09-e2e/))
